# -Virtual-Healthcare-Assistant
The aim of this project was to design a virtual healthcare system that, while not capable of performing all tasks, could efficiently handle essential functions. The project took the form of a chatbot developed using the Java programming language. The core of the system involved creating a knowledge base with Artificial Intelligence concepts and old Artifical Intelligence language called "Prolog"(introduced in 1970s), predicates, and rules to enable symptom diagnosis. These AI-driven tools are increasingly being adopted by healthcare providers to reduce costs and simplify patient care. The chatbot simulates a conversation between a patient and a medical representative, offering intelligent, real-time support. Developing this project was challenging as team members had varying levels of expertise and understanding of Java and AI concepts.
