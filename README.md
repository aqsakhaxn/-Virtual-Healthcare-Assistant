# -Virtual-Healthcare-Assistant
The aim of this project was to design a virtual healthcare system that, while not capable of performing all tasks, could efficiently handle essential functions. The project took the form of a chatbot developed using the Java programming language. The core of the system involved creating a knowledge base with Artificial Intelligence concepts and old Artifical Intelligence language called "Prolog"(introduced in 1970s), predicates, and rules to enable symptom diagnosis. These AI-driven tools are increasingly being adopted by healthcare providers to reduce costs and simplify patient care. The chatbot simulates a conversation between a patient and a medical representative, offering intelligent, real-time support. Developing this project was challenging as team members had varying levels of expertise and understanding of Java and AI concepts.

Conclusion: 
This particular project is a momentary display of our skills and what the virtual assistance in 
healthcare domain using the methods of chat bot could look like. Like every other projection, 
this idea has also room to expand in particular ways and make its way formed. We have given a 
complex computing system to the world of technology which could be efficient contribution to 
working of systems. In environments where there are hundreds and thousands of processes going 
on in parallel, like in a healthcare, it is often impossible or extremely difficult to maintain 
accuracy and consistency of the information provided to the patients.
